AI: The error message you encountered:

```
An error occurred while recording: 'L' format requires 0 <= number <= 4294967295
```

suggests that there is a problem with the data type or size being written to the WAV file. This error is generally associated with the Python `wave` module when trying to write more data than the file format or system can handle. Here are a few potential issues and their solutions:

### Potential Issues and Solutions

1. **24-Bit PCM Support**: 
   - The `wave` module in Python natively supports only 8-bit and 16-bit samples. You're using 24-bit PCM (`pyaudio.paInt24`), which might not be directly supported by the `wave` module and could be causing the issue. 
   - **Solution**: Consider using 16-bit PCM (`pyaudio.paInt16`) instead. It's the most commonly supported format by various libraries and hardware.

2. **Large File Size**:
   - WAV files have a size limit due to their file format specification. Writing too much data can exceed the limits.
   - **Solution**: Ensure your recordings are not too long or split them into multiple files when a certain size is reached.

3. **Data Type/Size Issue**:
   - The error `'L' format requires 0 <= number <= 4294967295` points towards an integer overflow issue since it relates to the size of data tuples in a struct.
   - **Solution**: Ensure the data you're reading from the stream is correctly formatted and not excessively large when being processed or written.

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Even though you have garbage collection calls, excessive memory usage (by holding too many frames in memory before writing) could cause issues.
   - **Solution**: Write frames to the file as frequently as possible and eliminate unnecessary memory usage.

### Suggested Changes

Here's a modified version of the code taking into account some potential fixes:

```python
FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16  # Change to 16-bit PCM
CHANNELS = 2              
CHUNK = 512

# Record function
def record():
    total_data_size_gc = 0
    try:
        with wave.open(OUTPUT_FILENAME, 'wb') as wf:
            wf.setnchannels(default_speakers["maxInputChannels"])
            wf.setsampwidth(audio.get_sample_size(FORMAT))
            wf.setframerate(int(default_speakers["defaultSampleRate"]))

            while not stop_recording:
                if pause_recording:
                    time.sleep(0.1)
                    continue
                data = stream.read(CHUNK, exception_on_overflow=False)  # Avoid overflow issues
                wf.writeframes(data)
                total_data_size_gc += len(data)

                if total_data_size_gc >= 50 * 1024 * 1024:
                    gc.collect()
                    total_data_size_gc = 0
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while recording: {str(e)}")
```

### Additional Recommendations
- **Testing**: Once you change to 16-bit PCM, test if you can record successfully for a duration similar to where your previous attempt failed.
- **Handling Silence Path**: Ensure any processing (e.g., silence detection) does not alter the frame count in a way that becomes incompatible with your file's settings.
- **Error Logging**: You might want to expand error handling and logging to catch and track issues more accurately.

These changes should help prevent the errors caused by data format and file size limitations.
