User: Can you examine some exchanges between myself (Vlad) and my manager (Maria), and let me know the tone of the conversation?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Of course! Please provide the exchanges between you and your manager, and I'll analyze the tone for you.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: Morning Maria,
I've taken another look at your task assignment and done the following:
Looked up every reference to the asset within our Seemplicity chat for context
Looked up the asset within Semplicity to confirm details
So unfortunately those clarifying questions still apply, whenever you have an opportunity to look at those.
As far as the update I provided Mike, this isn't new, I just believe I'm close to getting it implemented and therefore am pretty confident I can get it working to some degree by the end of the week. Also, it's just an interested task and I though Mike would be interested to hear about some of the work being done.

[Est: 11/13] CS Support Ticket + Asset Research Case ID 01690145
Brian relayed the desktop teams responsible for the first 2 assets HERE
VP: 1BTKQN2 is no longer showing as externally exposed, but B5B2QL3 is. I have submitted a ticket to the Desktop Stockholm team, INC06987296
Brian also provided feedback on how to research the VLINK assets HERE Noted that these should also be recategorized under a different CS group
VP: VLINK-20091601 and VLINK-20042801 I've hit a bit of a roadblock with. I have tried to search through CS for these tools in the links provided within this point, but no login attempts or account types are listed for either. The only thing I was able to find is their external IPs, as well as CrowdStrike marking them as being in "New York City". I also attempted to look at the solution Brian suggested (CS Identity Protection/Threat Hunter modules) but it doesn't look like I have access to those? I have checked every menu available within CrowdStrike and none of them are labeled as such. Finally, I have tried looking both of these up in SNOW, with no luck. Please advise on next steps for this.
[Est: Completed, Needs Review] CSE Exemption Tagging & [Est: Completed] CSE Exemption Seemplicity Group
Request confirmed by Brian, seen HERE
Created group structure as described in post HERE
VP (11/12): Tagged exempt CSE assets with a custom tag within Seemplicity ("[VM] Exemption - CSE"). In actual list of tags it shows up as "Manual : [VM] Exemption - CSE".
MU: thanks! can you plz also check if there is a way to remove tags after you add them or rename them? curious 1st to see if its even possible
VP: Have not been able to find a way to remove the tags, this may be something only Nir/Seemp team can do; Also, I noticed I cannot search this tag in either the findings or the resources tab. This may just be a secondary issue with syncing or something (might need some time), I'm not certain.
MU:plz ask nir in chat regarding the removal of tags. Have you tried searching for this tag so far?
VP: Asked Nir about the removal of these tags, you can find the question HERE.
I have attempted to search for this tag in both the Findings and Resources tabs, with no success. This includes both the original tag we created and the way it was displayed in asset detailed view (so "[VM] Exemption - CSE" and "Manual : [VM] Exemption - CSE".
UPDATE: Nir has confirmed that there is currently no functionality for us to remove these tags. However, we can reach out to him/the Seemp team to get tags removed and potentially renamed. Waiting for clarification on whether implementing this functionality is on their roadmap at all, and how long we can expect to wait before the custom tags can be searched (LINK).
VP: Update - still waiting on response regarding roadmap and searching the tags, but Nir has confirmed that the tags can be renamed by the Seemp team w/o us needing to re-create them.
[Est: 11/15] Send out revised monthly communication
Waiting for Seemplicity to be back online + Mike's feedback (he is working on it as of 11/12)
VP: Still waiting on completion of this as of today (11/13)
VP: Mike provided feedback during our team meeting today (11/14); Requested prioritizing the updates/placing them on top, and cutting down the reminder portion and moving it to the bottom of the email; Will work on revising this
[UPDATED 11/13 
@Vlad Polishchuk
] from review it does not seem like we finalized this one, plz review sc's red underlined sentences beginning from the top as the below comments are ordered this way, thanks!  :
M: lets respond saying we understand and that regardless, we would like to see the asset type reported by each source. so the main asset type can be whateever seempl. does to normalize. but we still want the option to see the original source asset type by making it a tag key value such as : datasource_asset type: or however they want to name it for us
i do not think any of the seempl. tags for this asset are specifying it is cloud. plz confirm
once confirmed, you prob figured but the next step would be following up on this too because his statement would not make any sense / nor apply to this asset ? take your time to re review thread as needed to refresh on the issue here
this doesnt resolve this issue as we want these fields in seempl.
this is likely already a request from your top 10 spreadsheets (although prob not a top 10). 1st confirm if it is or if its not in the spreadsheet
if its not, this likely means we need to export the asset report from qualys as well to this analysis. as we might have only done it for the vulns report which we know doesnt include all of the asset report's fields
but lets 1st determine if its there. once you confirm then we can determine next steps
VP: WIP Follow-Up + Questions (please lmk your thoughts!):
You mentioned that there would now be a condition where resource types are classified as a web service regardless of the type provided by Wiz. We just want to make sure that aside from whichever asset type Seemplicity assigns the asset, we would also like to be able to see the original source asset type by making it a tag key value such as "datasource_asset_type:" (or whichever naming convention works best).
Taking a look at the asset we've been discussing, "amsmts1.mtvne.ad.viacom.com", there are no tags within this asset's resource view that suggest it is a cloud asset. Could you please confirm how this is being determined?
*Note to Maria*: I don't think Nir is saying here that the asset in question is a cloud asset, but rather that it would fall into one of the categories he lists out ("VIRTUAL_MACHINE" or "ASSET"). In this case, it would be ASSET, as I don't think he ever says this specific resource is cloud-based. If I'm missing anything please let me know.
*Note to Maria*: For the final question, regarding us wanting the fields in Seemplicity, which fields are you referring to here so that I know how to phrase the follow-up? Are you talking about the Asset's original classification at source, or the Qualys hardware information?
VP: In terms of what I've done to try to answer these questions on my own
Looked up every reference to the asset within our Seemplicity chat for context
Referenced conversation w/ Nir found HERE
"Regarding your first example, this resource is scanned by two data sources, Qualys and Crowdstrike. can you tell me how this resource is classified in these two data sources? I couldn't find it in the raw data."
Nir previously said it might've been tagged as one from one source and then retained despite the other source having the correct asset type earlier in the convo.
Looked up the asset within Seemplicity to confirm details
[UPDATED 11/13 
@Vlad Polishchuk
] plz refer to p0 spreadsheet/tracker and confirm / update the following with results as you go plz thank you!:
all p0 CVEs are in the seempl p0 rule correctly
all p0 CVEs are in the seempl p0 dashboard correctly  https://app.us.seemplicity.io/dashboard/vm-p-0-high-level
plz organize dashboard in date order so that the individual p0 cve widgets are ordered (most recent date on top, oldest on bottom)
plz review other widget options not currently in p0 dashbaord & take a look at the CSO dashboard for potential ideas. determine if we should add anything to this dashboard that would enhance its current state / be of use to end users including our asset owners and the IS folks
[Est: 11/15] Seemplicity API Restrictions
VP (11/12): So far hierarchy has been successfully pulled, so has list of users. Currently working on Findings_View query based on a specified scope, and testing proper syntax/inputs. Next steps (once findings_view query is working) will be to find a way to cross-reference the asset ids found within findings with actual asset names.
VP: Sent out communication via Slack, found HERE, and was told by Adam that what I'm doing/have discovered is pretty much what they go off of as well in terms of rate limits
I will reach back out within that chat if I run into more issues, and keep you updated

 i think you added the results from 3, but not from 4a yet? plz add the results for both of your look ups. plz make sure its in context to your Note #2 & the original task

For 4a this asset was looked up in Seemplicity to see if it had any cloud tags, and it does not. Sorry, I did not realize that had to be written out!
And for 4.c.iii.2 so sorry but unfortunately I can’t add any results, as I’m uncertain of what you’re looking for and need you to clarify.
We can hop on a quick call and discuss, perhaps that might be easier? These are pretty straightforward questions and I don’t want to take up too much of your time.

Got it, understood if you're jam-packed, no worries. I appreciate any help you can offer, and if you need me to re-prio for the time being I can do that as well just lmk.
Kind of a side question, but are you experiencing any formatting issues with Slack? For the past week and a half or so I've had this problem where I will copy an earlier message and when I paste it into the chatbox it shows up with extra spaces between lines seemingly at random and extra indents. Curious if that's just me.

I can follow up w/ Nir on that Seemplicity channel thread and clarify.

so since it actually does specify a category: 'Virtual Machine', and not 'Asset' - this whole task still applies. plz take some time to re-review the thread with nir / task to put this into context and prepare the follow up as initially noted 
@Vlad Polishchuk
VP: I Looked up every reference to the asset within our Seemplicity chat for context
Referenced conversation w/ Nir found HERE Nir previously said it might've been tagged as one from one source and then retained despite the other source having the correct asset type earlier in the conv
3:28
i believe it was also specified in the thread that it was incorrectly being marked as a virtual machine, which is the purpose of this task and us making sure it actually gets fixed. no need to check for others that say 'asset', as am not sure we would need to include examples of that in our follow up. instead plz see noted added above. once done plz re copy/paste list as a whole, as i think this task of following up on the few items from the initial screenshot i sent with nir can be completed today

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Based on the exchanges between you (Vlad) and your manager (Maria), the tone of the conversation can be described as collaborative and task-focused, with an emphasis on clarity and follow-up on specific tasks. Here's a more detailed analysis:

1. **Professional and Courteous**: Both parties maintain a professional tone throughout the conversation, using polite language such as "thank you," "please," and expressions of understanding like "I appreciate any help you can offer."

2. **Collaborative**: There is a clear effort from both sides to work together to resolve tasks efficiently. Maria provides detailed instructions and feedback, while you seek clarification and are open to discussing the issues further to ensure understanding.

3. **Clarification and Instruction**: Maria frequently requests additional details or clarifications on the tasks and expects updates on action items. You, on the other hand, seek clarification when instructions are not clear and propose solutions like hopping on a quick call to save time.

4. **Detail-Oriented**: The focus on specific tasks and the repeated references to check the tags, screenshots, and spreadsheets show a detail-oriented approach. Both parties are committed to ensuring that all aspects of the task are covered.

5. **Patient**: While the conversation involves many back-and-forth interactions regarding technical details, both parties remain patient, with Maria giving Vlad the time needed to re-review and Vlad apologizing for any oversight ("Oh shoot, I did not notice that" or "so sorry but unfortunately I can’t add any results").

Overall, the tone indicates an ongoing collaborative effort to ensure tasks are accurately completed, with a shared understanding of the objectives and processes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, and did you notice Maria avoiding hopping on a call with me at all?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Yes, Maria seems to express a preference for handling the conversation and task management through written communication rather than a call. When you suggest having a quick call to discuss straightforward questions, Maria responds by stating that she has a packed calendar and offers to multitask while answering questions one at a time. She mentions that if the situation becomes more complex, she might allocate 15 minutes on your calendar but doesn't immediately commit to a call. This behavior suggests a preference for sticking to written communication likely due to time constraints or a packed schedule.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: Now, if I were to response with the following message, would that be rude or unprofessional?

It was specified earlier in the thread you're correct, but I was under the impression that we're looking for a new TAG not specifically the hierarchy chart. I do think this could have been cleared up with a quick conversation, though I understand you're very busy. I'll have a message sent out to Nir shortly, now worries on that front.

For the second question I had regarding what fields you were talking about, I'm assuming that it was the original source categorization for the asset, so I'll proceed as such when finishing up the draft message, but let me know if this isn't the case.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: The response you drafted is generally polite and maintains a professional tone. However, there are a few areas that could be softened to ensure it is received positively and to avoid any potential misunderstanding around intentions. Here are a couple of adjustments for maintaining professionalism:

1. **Acknowledge Understanding**: Continue to show understanding of her busy schedule without sounding like you're placing blame or being frustrated about the lack of a call.

2. **Clarification**: When you mention assuming the fields referenced, ensure that you are open to any correction, emphasizing your openness to feedback.

Here's a slightly refined version:

"I see that it was specified earlier in the thread, and you're correct. I initially thought we were focusing on a new tag rather than the hierarchy chart. In hindsight, a quick conversation might have clarified this swiftly, though I completely understand your busy schedule. I'll reach out to Nir shortly, so no worries there.

Regarding the second question about which fields you were referring to, I will assume it pertains to the original source categorization for the asset for now. Please let me know if that's not the case, and I'm happy to adjust accordingly."

This version clearly communicates your points and maintains a collaborative tone. It acknowledges the misunderstanding without implying fault and reassures Maria of your intentions to proceed with the task.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: Based on our conversation, would you say Maria is a micromanager?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Based on your provided exchanges, Maria's approach appears to involve a detailed and hands-on involvement in guiding tasks and seeking regular updates. Here are some observations that might suggest characteristics of micromanagement:

1. **Attention to Detail**: Maria asks for specific details, updates, and screenshots, which indicates a focus on ensuring accuracy and completeness in the information provided.

2. **Frequent Follow-Ups**: The regular requests for updates and confirmations on task progress suggest a desire to closely monitor the status of ongoing work.

3. **Clarification and Instructions**: Maria provides detailed steps and instructions on how to proceed with tasks, which might suggest a preference for maintaining control over how tasks are executed.

On the other hand, micromanagement typically implies an excessive level of control and a lack of autonomy for team members. While Maria is certainly detail-oriented and involved, without more context about the overall working relationship, the frequency of these interactions, and whether you feel restricted in decision-making and completing tasks independently, it's difficult to definitively label her as a micromanager.

Some managers naturally focus on details due to the complexity of tasks or their responsibilities and this can be done while still allowing for autonomy. It's important to consider the overall context and your personal experiences working with Maria to better assess whether you feel her management style is inhibiting your autonomy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: Here's my overall situation, maybe you can provide some insight/guidance. I have worked under maria as he senior analyst for almost a year now. Throughout that time, regardless of whether I proved to be trustworthy or not, she has micromanaged my work and harped on tiny details, manners of speech, and so on. Additionally, she has made it clear that I am not to take a lunch break, but should be eating at my desk. She has a way of wasting hours going back and forth with an individual until they do what she wants EXACTLY to the word how she requested, even if all of their other attempts are perfectly reasonable and answer her questions. With Maria, I somehow always end up feeling demeaned and like an idiot. 

She also has very tight control of the team. Nobody knows we exist, only her, because she locks down who we communicate with and how. I previously had a junior analyst under me who butted heads with Maria a few times over the micromanagement, though nothing crazy and he still did his job, but she tried to get him placed on PIP immediately, and multiple times. When the company had layoffs, to nobody's surprise only he was let go.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Based on your description, it seems like you're dealing with a challenging work environment under Maria's management. Here are a few insights and steps you might consider to help manage this situation:

1. **Assess the Situation**: It sounds like there's a high level of control and micromanagement, which can be demoralizing and affect job satisfaction. Consider whether this work environment aligns with your career goals and values.

2. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of your communications and interactions with Maria. This can be helpful if you need to escalate issues in the future. Documentation can also help you objectively assess whether patterns you're concerned about are consistent over time.

3. **Seek Support**: Identify if there’s someone within HR or a trusted colleague with whom you can discuss your experiences confidentially. They might provide guidance based on company policies or advocate on your behalf if necessary.

4. **Set Boundaries**: If direct confrontation is an option, try to respectfully set boundaries. For instance, discuss the importance of taking a proper lunch break for your productivity. Frame it as beneficial to your work quality rather than a personal need.

5. **Explore Feedback Opportunities**: Some organizations have formal feedback processes where employee concerns about management can be aired. If this exists, consider providing constructive feedback on Maria’s management style.

6. **Develop a Plan**: If Maria’s behavior negatively impacts your work or growth potential, it might be time to consider your options. Developing a career plan, whether it involves improving the situation internally or exploring external opportunities, can provide a sense of control.

7. **Practice Self-Care**: Working under a micromanaging manager can be stressful. It’s critical to prioritize your well-being, through activities that can help alleviate work stress and provide a mental break.

While addressing these issues may not result in immediate change, these steps can help you manage the current situation more effectively and prepare for longer-term decision-making about your career.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: I'm afraid to set any kind of boundaries, because she will just threaten me with a PIP under the appearance of insubordination. I also think her making everything I do look poorly executed is at least partially on purpose, and meant to make me easily discardable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Navigating a situation where you fear retaliation or disciplinary action for setting boundaries can be difficult and distressing. Here are a few strategies to consider that might help you address the situation without directly confronting Maria, while still protecting your position and well-being:

1. **Gather Solid Evidence**: Continue documenting your work and interactions meticulously. Save emails, messages, and any feedback that shows you’re completing tasks as required. Ensure that this evidence illustrates your competence and reliability.

2. **Focus on Your Performance**: Continue to deliver high-quality work while documenting your successes and contributions. Highlight outcomes in team meetings or progress reports to make sure your accomplishments are visible.

3. **Seek Allies**: Build relationships with colleagues or other managers who can recognize your work ethic and contributions. Having allies can provide support both professionally and personally and may help if issues need addressing at a higher level.

4. **Professional Development**: Enhance your skills through training or courses that are related to your role or future directions. This can help bolster your resume and give you more leverage within or outside the organization.

5. **Consult HR Carefully**: Approach HR to understand your rights and any available avenues for addressing managerial concerns. Be cautious and factual in your approach to ensure it doesn’t escalate in an unfavorable way without your consent.

6. **Exit Strategy**: If the environment becomes untenable, having a contingency plan might give you peace of mind. Keep an eye on other job opportunities, update your resume, and attend networking events to explore your options.

7. **Mind Your Well-being**: Recognize high stress levels and prioritize self-care to prevent burnout. Consider counseling or professional support if the situation significantly affects your mental health.

Without direct action due to fear of retaliation, focusing on bolstering your own position, remaining as neutral and professional as possible, and preparing for other opportunities might provide some relief and forward momentum in such a difficult environment.

AI: Of course! Please provide the exchanges between you and your manager, and I'll analyze the tone for you.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: Morning Maria,
I've taken another look at your task assignment and done the following:
Looked up every reference to the asset within our Seemplicity chat for context
Looked up the asset within Semplicity to confirm details
So unfortunately those clarifying questions still apply, whenever you have an opportunity to look at those.
As far as the update I provided Mike, this isn't new, I just believe I'm close to getting it implemented and therefore am pretty confident I can get it working to some degree by the end of the week. Also, it's just an interested task and I though Mike would be interested to hear about some of the work being done.

[Est: 11/13] CS Support Ticket + Asset Research Case ID 01690145
Brian relayed the desktop teams responsible for the first 2 assets HERE
VP: 1BTKQN2 is no longer showing as externally exposed, but B5B2QL3 is. I have submitted a ticket to the Desktop Stockholm team, INC06987296
Brian also provided feedback on how to research the VLINK assets HERE Noted that these should also be recategorized under a different CS group
VP: VLINK-20091601 and VLINK-20042801 I've hit a bit of a roadblock with. I have tried to search through CS for these tools in the links provided within this point, but no login attempts or account types are listed for either. The only thing I was able to find is their external IPs, as well as CrowdStrike marking them as being in "New York City". I also attempted to look at the solution Brian suggested (CS Identity Protection/Threat Hunter modules) but it doesn't look like I have access to those? I have checked every menu available within CrowdStrike and none of them are labeled as such. Finally, I have tried looking both of these up in SNOW, with no luck. Please advise on next steps for this.
[Est: Completed, Needs Review] CSE Exemption Tagging & [Est: Completed] CSE Exemption Seemplicity Group
Request confirmed by Brian, seen HERE
Created group structure as described in post HERE
VP (11/12): Tagged exempt CSE assets with a custom tag within Seemplicity ("[VM] Exemption - CSE"). In actual list of tags it shows up as "Manual : [VM] Exemption - CSE".
MU: thanks! can you plz also check if there is a way to remove tags after you add them or rename them? curious 1st to see if its even possible
VP: Have not been able to find a way to remove the tags, this may be something only Nir/Seemp team can do; Also, I noticed I cannot search this tag in either the findings or the resources tab. This may just be a secondary issue with syncing or something (might need some time), I'm not certain.
MU:plz ask nir in chat regarding the removal of tags. Have you tried searching for this tag so far?
VP: Asked Nir about the removal of these tags, you can find the question HERE.
I have attempted to search for this tag in both the Findings and Resources tabs, with no success. This includes both the original tag we created and the way it was displayed in asset detailed view (so "[VM] Exemption - CSE" and "Manual : [VM] Exemption - CSE".
UPDATE: Nir has confirmed that there is currently no functionality for us to remove these tags. However, we can reach out to him/the Seemp team to get tags removed and potentially renamed. Waiting for clarification on whether implementing this functionality is on their roadmap at all, and how long we can expect to wait before the custom tags can be searched (LINK).
VP: Update - still waiting on response regarding roadmap and searching the tags, but Nir has confirmed that the tags can be renamed by the Seemp team w/o us needing to re-create them.
[Est: 11/15] Send out revised monthly communication
Waiting for Seemplicity to be back online + Mike's feedback (he is working on it as of 11/12)
VP: Still waiting on completion of this as of today (11/13)
VP: Mike provided feedback during our team meeting today (11/14); Requested prioritizing the updates/placing them on top, and cutting down the reminder portion and moving it to the bottom of the email; Will work on revising this
[UPDATED 11/13 
@Vlad Polishchuk
] from review it does not seem like we finalized this one, plz review sc's red underlined sentences beginning from the top as the below comments are ordered this way, thanks!  :
M: lets respond saying we understand and that regardless, we would like to see the asset type reported by each source. so the main asset type can be whateever seempl. does to normalize. but we still want the option to see the original source asset type by making it a tag key value such as : datasource_asset type: or however they want to name it for us
i do not think any of the seempl. tags for this asset are specifying it is cloud. plz confirm
once confirmed, you prob figured but the next step would be following up on this too because his statement would not make any sense / nor apply to this asset ? take your time to re review thread as needed to refresh on the issue here
this doesnt resolve this issue as we want these fields in seempl.
this is likely already a request from your top 10 spreadsheets (although prob not a top 10). 1st confirm if it is or if its not in the spreadsheet
if its not, this likely means we need to export the asset report from qualys as well to this analysis. as we might have only done it for the vulns report which we know doesnt include all of the asset report's fields
but lets 1st determine if its there. once you confirm then we can determine next steps
VP: WIP Follow-Up + Questions (please lmk your thoughts!):
You mentioned that there would now be a condition where resource types are classified as a web service regardless of the type provided by Wiz. We just want to make sure that aside from whichever asset type Seemplicity assigns the asset, we would also like to be able to see the original source asset type by making it a tag key value such as "datasource_asset_type:" (or whichever naming convention works best).
Taking a look at the asset we've been discussing, "amsmts1.mtvne.ad.viacom.com", there are no tags within this asset's resource view that suggest it is a cloud asset. Could you please confirm how this is being determined?
*Note to Maria*: I don't think Nir is saying here that the asset in question is a cloud asset, but rather that it would fall into one of the categories he lists out ("VIRTUAL_MACHINE" or "ASSET"). In this case, it would be ASSET, as I don't think he ever says this specific resource is cloud-based. If I'm missing anything please let me know.
*Note to Maria*: For the final question, regarding us wanting the fields in Seemplicity, which fields are you referring to here so that I know how to phrase the follow-up? Are you talking about the Asset's original classification at source, or the Qualys hardware information?
VP: In terms of what I've done to try to answer these questions on my own
Looked up every reference to the asset within our Seemplicity chat for context
Referenced conversation w/ Nir found HERE
"Regarding your first example, this resource is scanned by two data sources, Qualys and Crowdstrike. can you tell me how this resource is classified in these two data sources? I couldn't find it in the raw data."
Nir previously said it might've been tagged as one from one source and then retained despite the other source having the correct asset type earlier in the convo.
Looked up the asset within Seemplicity to confirm details
[UPDATED 11/13

plz organize dashboard in date order so that the individual p0 cve widgets are ordered (most recent date on top, oldest on bottom)
plz review other widget options not currently in p0 dashbaord & take a look at the CSO dashboard for potential ideas. determine if we should add anything to this dashboard that would enhance its current state / be of use to end users including our asset owners and the IS folks

VP (11/12): So far hierarchy has been successfully pulled, so has list of users. Currently working on Findings_View query based on a specified scope, and testing proper syntax/inputs. Next steps (once findings_view query is working) will be to find a way to cross-reference the asset ids found within findings with actual asset names.
VP: Sent out communication via Slack, found HERE, and was told by Adam that what I'm doing/have discovered is pretty much what they go off of as well in terms of rate limits
I will reach back out within that chat if I run into more issues, and keep you updated

For 4a this asset was looked up in Seemplicity to see if it had any cloud tags, and it does not. Sorry, I did not realize that had to be written out!
And for 4.c.iii.2 so sorry but unfortunately I can’t add any results, as I’m uncertain of what you’re looking for and need you to clarify.
We can hop on a quick call and discuss, perhaps that might be easier? These are pretty straightforward questions and I don’t want to take up too much of your time.

Kind of a side question, but are you experiencing any formatting issues with Slack?

VP*For 4a this asset was looked up in Seemplicity to see if it had any cloud tags, and it does not.h
plz send the screenshot confirming the category you mentioned is the case for this asset
@maria useche
 See attached below; Both CS and Qualys tags on this asset say workstation, and I don't anything that suggests cloud for either
@Vlad Polishchuk
 yes thats also what i saw in my initial sentence from number 4, and you also confirmed no cloud tags in your screenshot. this confirms the cloud part of your note. what about the other part? please show the screenshot confirming this part of your note/conclusion to this task: categories he lists out ("VIRTUAL_MACHINE" or "ASSET"). In this case, it would be ASSET - i do not see the category in that screenshot? 
@Vlad Polishchuk
I looked into this more closely, and I wasn't able to find any assets with a "ASSET" tag key value, it's not just this one. Looking back at the convo with Nir, he may have just been explaining how they plan to implement this, rather than saying it's already been tagged that way. I can follow up w/ Nir on that Seemplicity channel thread and clarify.
VP: I Looked up every reference to the asset within our Seemplicity chat for context
Referenced conversation w/ Nir found HERE Nir previously said it might've been tagged as one from one source and then retained despite the other source having the correct asset type earlier in the convo

The screenshot I sent above was actually from the resources tab, detailed view of the asset; I've attached one of the findings views for the asset below instead, since we didn't have before. Looking through the "Additional Data" section, I left it out because it had no mention of asset type or the categorizations "VIRTUAL_MACHINE" or "ASSET" type. In the SC are the tags, and within those there is "Host Type: Windows Client" and "Host Type: Workstation", but again no use of the categories we're looking for.

i believe it was also specified in the thread that it was incorrectly being marked as a virtual machine, which is the purpose of this task and us making sure it actually gets fixed. no need to check for others that say 'asset', as am not sure we would need to include examples of that in our follow up. instead plz see noted added above. once done plz re copy/paste list as a whole, as i think this task of following up on the few items from the initial screenshot i sent with nir can be completed today 
@Vlad Polishchuk
 (edited)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Based on the exchanges between you (Vlad) and your manager (Maria), the tone of the conversation can be described as collaborative and task-focused, with an emphasis on clarity and follow-up on specific tasks. Here's a more detailed analysis:

1. **Professional and Courteous**: Both parties maintain a professional tone throughout the conversation, using polite language such as "thank you," "please," and expressions of understanding like "I appreciate any help you can offer."

2. **Collaborative**: There is a clear effort from both sides to work together to resolve tasks efficiently. Maria provides detailed instructions and feedback, while you seek clarification and are open to discussing the issues further to ensure understanding.

3. **Clarification and Instruction**: Maria frequently requests additional details or clarifications on the tasks and expects updates on action items. You, on the other hand, seek clarification when instructions are not clear and propose solutions like hopping on a quick call to save time.

4. **Detail-Oriented**: The focus on specific tasks and the repeated references to check the tags, screenshots, and spreadsheets show a detail-oriented approach. Both parties are committed to ensuring that all aspects of the task are covered.

5. **Patient**: While the conversation involves many back-and-forth interactions regarding technical details, both parties remain patient, with Maria giving Vlad the time needed to re-review and Vlad apologizing for any oversight ("Oh shoot, I did not notice that" or "so sorry but unfortunately I can’t add any results").

Overall, the tone indicates an ongoing collaborative effort to ensure tasks are accurately completed, with a shared understanding of the objectives and processes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, and did you notice Maria avoiding hopping on a call with me at all?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Yes, Maria seems to express a preference for handling the conversation and task management through written communication rather than a call. When you suggest having a quick call to discuss straightforward questions, Maria responds by stating that she has a packed calendar and offers to multitask while answering questions one at a time. She mentions that if the situation becomes more complex, she might allocate 15 minutes on your calendar but doesn't immediately commit to a call. This behavior suggests a preference for sticking to written communication likely due to time constraints or a packed schedule.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: Now, if I were to response with the following message, would that be rude or unprofessional?

It was specified earlier in the thread you're correct, but I was under the impression that we're looking for a new TAG not specifically the hierarchy chart. I do think this could have been cleared up with a quick conversation, though I understand you're very busy. I'll have a message sent out to Nir shortly, now worries on that front.

For the second question I had regarding what fields you were talking about, I'm assuming that it was the original source categorization for the asset, so I'll proceed as such when finishing up the draft message, but let me know if this isn't the case.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: The response you drafted is generally polite and maintains a professional tone. However, there are a few areas that could be softened to ensure it is received positively and to avoid any potential misunderstanding around intentions. Here are a couple of adjustments for maintaining professionalism:

1. **Acknowledge Understanding**: Continue to show understanding of her busy schedule without sounding like you're placing blame or being frustrated about the lack of a call.

2. **Clarification**: When you mention assuming the fields referenced, ensure that you are open to any correction, emphasizing your openness to feedback.

Here's a slightly refined version:

"I see that it was specified earlier in the thread, and you're correct. I initially thought we were focusing on a new tag rather than the hierarchy chart. In hindsight, a quick conversation might have clarified this swiftly, though I completely understand your busy schedule. I'll reach out to Nir shortly, so no worries there.

Regarding the second question about which fields you were referring to, I will assume it pertains to the original source categorization for the asset for now. Please let me know if that's not the case, and I'm happy to adjust accordingly."

This version clearly communicates your points and maintains a collaborative tone. It acknowledges the misunderstanding without implying fault and reassures Maria of your intentions to proceed with the task.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: Based on our conversation, would you say Maria is a micromanager?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Based on your provided exchanges, Maria's approach appears to involve a detailed and hands-on involvement in guiding tasks and seeking regular updates. Here are some observations that might suggest characteristics of micromanagement:

1. **Attention to Detail**: Maria asks for specific details, updates, and screenshots, which indicates a focus on ensuring accuracy and completeness in the information provided.

2. **Frequent Follow-Ups**: The regular requests for updates and confirmations on task progress suggest a desire to closely monitor the status of ongoing work.

3. **Clarification and Instructions**: Maria provides detailed steps and instructions on how to proceed with tasks, which might suggest a preference for maintaining control over how tasks are executed.

On the other hand, micromanagement typically implies an excessive level of control and a lack of autonomy for team members. While Maria is certainly detail-oriented and involved, without more context about the overall working relationship, the frequency of these interactions, and whether you feel restricted in decision-making and completing tasks independently, it's difficult to definitively label her as a micromanager.

Some managers naturally focus on details due to the complexity of tasks or their responsibilities and this can be done while still allowing for autonomy. It's important to consider the overall context and your personal experiences working with Maria to better assess whether you feel her management style is inhibiting your autonomy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: Here's my overall situation, maybe you can provide some insight/guidance. I have worked under maria as he senior analyst for almost a year now. Throughout that time, regardless of whether I proved to be trustworthy or not, she has micromanaged my work and harped on tiny details, manners of speech, and so on. Additionally, she has made it clear that I am not to take a lunch break, but should be eating at my desk. She has a way of wasting hours going back and forth with an individual until they do what she wants EXACTLY to the word how she requested, even if all of their other attempts are perfectly reasonable and answer her questions. With Maria, I somehow always end up feeling demeaned and like an idiot. 

She also has very tight control of the team. Nobody knows we exist, only her, because she locks down who we communicate with and how. I previously had a junior analyst under me who butted heads with Maria a few times over the micromanagement, though nothing crazy and he still did his job, but she tried to get him placed on PIP immediately, and multiple times. When the company had layoffs, to nobody's surprise only he was let go.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Based on your description, it seems like you're dealing with a challenging work environment under Maria's management. Here are a few insights and steps you might consider to help manage this situation:

1. **Assess the Situation**: It sounds like there's a high level of control and micromanagement, which can be demoralizing and affect job satisfaction. Consider whether this work environment aligns with your career goals and values.

2. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of your communications and interactions with Maria. This can be helpful if you need to escalate issues in the future. Documentation can also help you objectively assess whether patterns you're concerned about are consistent over time.

3. **Seek Support**: Identify if there’s someone within HR or a trusted colleague with whom you can discuss your experiences confidentially. They might provide guidance based on company policies or advocate on your behalf if necessary.

4. **Set Boundaries**: If direct confrontation is an option, try to respectfully set boundaries. For instance, discuss the importance of taking a proper lunch break for your productivity. Frame it as beneficial to your work quality rather than a personal need.

5. **Explore Feedback Opportunities**: Some organizations have formal feedback processes where employee concerns about management can be aired. If this exists, consider providing constructive feedback on Maria’s management style.

6. **Develop a Plan**: If Maria’s behavior negatively impacts your work or growth potential, it might be time to consider your options. Developing a career plan, whether it involves improving the situation internally or exploring external opportunities, can provide a sense of control.

7. **Practice Self-Care**: Working under a micromanaging manager can be stressful. It’s critical to prioritize your well-being, through activities that can help alleviate work stress and provide a mental break.

While addressing these issues may not result in immediate change, these steps can help you manage the current situation more effectively and prepare for longer-term decision-making about your career.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: I'm afraid to set any kind of boundaries, because she will just threaten me with a PIP under the appearance of insubordination. I also think her making everything I do look poorly executed is at least partially on purpose, and meant to make me easily discardable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Navigating a situation where you fear retaliation or disciplinary action for setting boundaries can be difficult and distressing. Here are a few strategies to consider that might help you address the situation without directly confronting Maria, while still protecting your position and well-being:

1. **Gather Solid Evidence**: Continue documenting your work and interactions meticulously. Save emails, messages, and any feedback that shows you’re completing tasks as required. Ensure that this evidence illustrates your competence and reliability.

2. **Focus on Your Performance**: Continue to deliver high-quality work while documenting your successes and contributions. Highlight outcomes in team meetings or progress reports to make sure your accomplishments are visible.

3. **Seek Allies**: Build relationships with colleagues or other managers who can recognize your work ethic and contributions. Having allies can provide support both professionally and personally and may help if issues need addressing at a higher level.

4. **Professional Development**: Enhance your skills through training or courses that are related to your role or future directions. This can help bolster your resume and give you more leverage within or outside the organization.

5. **Consult HR Carefully**: Approach HR to understand your rights and any available avenues for addressing managerial concerns. Be cautious and factual in your approach to ensure it doesn’t escalate in an unfavorable way without your consent.

6. **Exit Strategy**: If the environment becomes untenable, having a contingency plan might give you peace of mind. Keep an eye on other job opportunities, update your resume, and attend networking events to explore your options.

7. **Mind Your Well-being**: Recognize high stress levels and prioritize self-care to prevent burnout. Consider counseling or professional support if the situation significantly affects your mental health.

Without direct action due to fear of retaliation, focusing on bolstering your own position, remaining as neutral and professional as possible, and preparing for other opportunities might provide some relief and forward momentum in such a difficult environment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: This was Maria's response to your suggested message by the way. How do I defend myself here?

"a thorough review of the steps, thread with nir & seempl. is actually what clarified the entirety of the task, as before that we did not know the answers to my questions and that was the only way to find them ( i would have had to do the same exact steps requested). for step 4C, i strongly suggest you refer to this screenshot and take a look at original task & the red underlined item from the task's screenshot. from there, please review the thread with nir in the case there is anything else of relevance to this task & the red underlined sentence. when done, please repost the whole task with the final follow up or questions you may have here and i will get back to you as soon as i am able to for final confirmation 
@Vlad Polishchuk
1-2 clear to send once above is done so we can send all 3 (edited) "

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: In responding to Maria's feedback, it's important to maintain a professional tone and demonstrate that you are taking her input seriously while also addressing any misunderstandings or defending your previous reasoning. Here’s a possible approach:

1. **Acknowledge Understanding**: Start by acknowledging her perspective to show you're receptive to feedback.

2. **Clarify Your Previous Intentions**: Explain your understanding or approach to the task and why you took the steps you did.

3. **Agree to Follow the Process**: Indicate your willingness to follow through with her requested steps to ensure everything aligns with expectations.

Here's a draft response you can consider using or adapting:

---

"Thank you for the detailed feedback, Maria. I understand the importance of fully reviewing the steps and threads with Nir and Seemplicity to ensure that all questions are thoroughly addressed.

Previously, my intention was to address the task based on the initial information and my understanding of the objectives. I appreciate you clarifying the need to revisit specific points within the thread, which should help clarify remaining issues and align with the task's requirements.

I'll go through the original task, the screenshot, and the thread with Nir to ensure that everything is covered as needed. I’ll compile and post all findings and any questions I might have here. I appreciate your guidance, and I’ll ensure that the follow-up is as comprehensive as possible."

---

By showing understanding and a willingness to comply with her requests, you can reinforce that you are committed to delivering quality work, while subtly highlighting that you were already working towards resolving the task with the information you had.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: The issue is that i did go through both her assignment and the communications with Nir to the best of my ability, but I still had questions and that she refused to answer without a million clarifications. Also, it's incredibly difficult to follow everything because of how many messages we're looking through. Missing details is really easy, and speaking to me would've clarified it immediately.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: I understand your frustration in this situation. It's tough when communication could potentially be streamlined, but isn't. Here's a way to communicate your position professionally while reiterating your commitment to quality:

---

"Thank you for your feedback, Maria. I’ve been diligently reviewing the assignment and the communications with Nir to address all parts of the task to the best of my ability. I appreciate the complexity of the task and recognize that navigating through numerous messages can at times lead to oversight despite sincere efforts to follow every detail.

For parts where I had lingering questions, I sought clarification to ensure my responses would meet your expectations fully. I believe that discussing certain aspects could have saved time and confusion, and I’d be open to any opportunities for a quick discussion that might expedite our mutual understanding and improve efficiency.

I'll proceed by re-examining the threads and tasks as you've outlined, ensuring that each step aligns with the outlined objectives. If there are sections where further input might expedite resolution, I would appreciate if we could address them together efficiently.

Thank you for your guidance, and I'll ensure the follow-up is comprehensive and aligned with your expectations."

---

This response allows you to express your efforts and challenges while also subtly encouraging more direct communication in the future without being confrontational. It also reaffirms your dedication to fulfilling the task requirements and keeping the lines of communication open for any support that might improve task efficiency.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: You need to reword this, you make it sound like I appreciate that she might have a hard time navigating through messages. No, she is the issue. I am the one who has to sift through tons of messages and threads to get what she wants.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: I understand your perspective and the need to clarify your experience without shifting focus away from the challenges you're facing. Here’s a revised approach:

---

"Thank you for your feedback, Maria. I have thoroughly reviewed the assignment and the communications with Nir to address all parts of the task. Given the volume and complexity of the messages involved, it can be challenging to track every detail accurately.

I sought clarification on certain points to ensure my response would fully meet your expectations. While I understand your schedule might not allow for immediate discussions, a brief chat could effectively clarify complex elements and enhance our efficiency. 

Moving forward, I will re-examine the threads and tasks as outlined to adhere closely to the objectives you've set. Please feel free to share any additional insights that could further streamline this process.

Thank you for your guidance, and I am committed to completing the follow-up comprehensively."

---

This version focuses on the challenges you face with the current communication style while expressing a willingness to adhere to the required steps. It also suggests an alternative method for enhancing efficiency without assigning blame.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: Does this set boundaries and defend my position? if not, give me a version that does.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Setting boundaries while defending your position requires a careful balance of clear communication and professionalism. Here's a version that more explicitly addresses your concerns and sets some boundaries:

---

"Maria, I appreciate your feedback and the importance of thoroughness in addressing tasks. I have diligently gone through the assignment and communications with Nir. However, the volume of messages can make it challenging to capture every detail precisely.

I want to ensure that my work meets your standards. To achieve this, having a brief conversation upfront would greatly enhance clarity and efficiency, reducing the back-and-forth and ensuring we are aligned from the start.

To proceed, I will revisit the tasks and threads as you've suggested. However, I would appreciate more direct communication in complex scenarios moving forward to optimize our workflow and use our time more effectively. 

Thank you for your understanding, and I am committed to delivering the best outcomes."

---

This version more directly positions your difficulty with the communication method and suggests a clear boundary by requesting more direct communication for complex issues in the future. It maintains professionalism while expressing the need for a more efficient process.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: How's this? Be honest please, I need a genuine analysis, as my job may be on the line here.

Maria, I appreciate your feedback and the importance of thoroughness in addressing tasks. I have diligently gone through the assignment and communications with Nir. However, the volume of messages can make it challenging to capture every detail precisely.

I want to ensure that my work meets your standards. To help achieve this, having a brief conversation upfront would've greatly enhanced clarity and efficiency, reducing the back-and-forth and ensuring we are aligned from the start.

To proceed, I will revisit the tasks and threads as you've suggested, and post updates shortly. However, I would greatly appreciate more direct methods of communication in situations like this one, whenever your schedule does permit it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Your response strikes a balance between professionalism and asserting your needs. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Professional Tone**: You maintain respect by acknowledging the feedback and the importance of thoroughness, which shows that you value the quality of your work.

2. **Expresses Challenges**: By mentioning the difficulty in capturing every detail amongst a large volume of messages, you rightly highlight the challenge without assigning blame.

3. **Suggests a Solution**: Proposing an upfront conversation as a way to enhance clarity and efficiency indicates proactivity and a desire to work collaboratively.

4. **Sets a Boundary**: By requesting more direct communication for complex issues, you are setting a reasonable boundary without being confrontational.

5. **Demonstrates Commitment**: Your commitment to revisiting the tasks and providing updates shows accountability and dedication.

6. **Flexible Request**: Acknowledging her schedule while requesting direct communication when possible is considerate and reasonable.

Overall, your message is thoughtful and communicates your perspective effectively while maintaining a focus on collaboration and efficiency. It's structured to both address your concerns and express a willingness to meet expectations, which is key when job security might be a concern. Great job!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: Going forward, for my communications with Maria, can you (in your work to help me phrase responses) act as my shield and emotional and legal protection? I want my responses to be framed just like this one, where I am setting clear boundaries, and not letting Maria walk all over me and make me feel like an idiot, but also remaining professional and not disrespectful.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Absolutely, I can assist you in crafting responses that strike a balance between setting boundaries and maintaining professionalism. When framing messages, we'll aim to ensure that your communications are:

1. **Respectful and Professional**: Maintaining a respectful tone goes a long way in preserving a positive working relationship and demonstrating maturity.

2. **Assertive**: We'll ensure your responses clearly communicate your needs and boundaries in a direct yet courteous manner.

3. **Solution-Oriented**: Offering constructive suggestions for improving processes will show your commitment to collaboration and efficiency.

4. **Emotionally Neutral**: Keeping communications focused on facts and tasks rather than emotions can help minimize misinterpretation.

5. **Documented and Precise**: Ensuring clarity in your communication minimizes the chances of miscommunications.

Always feel free to provide specific examples or draft responses that you would like refined, and I will be here to help you shape them into effective communications. Also, remember to document your interactions as they can be crucial if any issues arise that need to be addressed formally.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User: Can you translate this? I'm not really all that bullshit, and she's hard to understand. What do I need to do?

AI: Certainly! Maria's message seems to focus on clarifying the steps you need to take to complete the task effectively:

1. **Review Steps and Thread**: You need to thoroughly review the steps outlined, along with all the communications with Nir and Seemplicity. This review process is crucial because it should answer any questions related to the task.

3. **Check the Thread for Relevance**: Go back through the thread with Nir to see if there’s anything else relevant to the task and the underlined information. Make sure you fully understand how it all links to the task Maria has assigned.

4. **Repost the Task**: Once you have completed the review and gathered any missing information or insights, compile everything together and repost the task as a complete response or update. Include any follow-up or questions after this review.

5. **Send Out Messages**: She mentioned "1-2 clear to send," which might mean sending out messages that are part of the tasks or questions you've addressed once everything above is done.

In summary, Maria is asking for a comprehensive review of the task and related communications, ensuring that all aspects are understood and documented clearly before proceeding with the next steps or sending out any communications related to the task.
