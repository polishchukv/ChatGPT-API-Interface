Hi Peter, I'm reaching out regarding two assets that appear to be externally-exposed w/ ports 80, 81, and 443 open.
The first asset is VLINK-20091601 w/ IP 192.238.76.188 and an existing SNOW ticket that you previous responded to (INC06237537).
For this first asset, could you please re-confirm whether this is still the same COE-owned Vlink server, and whether those exposed ports are still expected behavior?
The second asset is VLINK-20042801 w/ IP 192.238.76.138 and no existing SNOW ticket or troubleshooting records on our end.
For this asset, I was wondering whether you could provide any additional context as to what it is, whether it also belong to COE, and whether the open ports are expected behavior as was seen with the previous asset?
I've been working on chasing down additional information regarding these two assets for several days now, so thank you in advance for any information you could share!

Hello Vlad and Maria, the first asset is the COE Vlink server.  The second asset is the CND vlink server. probably no snow tickets because this unit was workshopped with Lazarus and infosec prior to deployment. the 80,81, 443, 444 open is expected behavior.

I believe we were waiting for something on one of the other vlink servers before firewall rules were updated. 80 and 81 are routed to 443 and 444 respectively. there is still a push to close 80, 81 but not 443 ,444.

Apologies for the late follow-up Peter, but thank you for the detailed breakdown. You mentioned that there's a wait on the other vlink servers before firewall rules get updated - is there by any chance an estimated timeline for this?

No idea actually. We were having a weekly cadence with Ted moots but i forget where it was left. We were waiting on sports to update their servers

@peter.eilenberg
 any chance you are able to confirm who is responsible for patching these 2 servers? VLINK-20091601 w/ IP 192.238.76.188 & VLINK-20042801 w/ IP 192.238.76.138
would it be under cbs sports or coe?
no worries if not - we can check with the teams


Peter Eilenberg
:rogerroger:  9:15 AM
Technically it’s the owners. COE is James Valvo and CND is Phil Selby. Practically speaking the COE server is handled by Karol in the maintenance shop and CND unit usually  falls on me but unofficially

Is there an issue I should be aware of

Hi 
@peter.eilenberg
 not to my knowledge, we just want to make sure we have the appropriate owners for these assets as we had them previously incorrectly tagged to CSE, so now we want to ensure we update our tags to the appropriate group

Subject: Inquiry on Vlink Server Firewall Rule Updates

Hi Ted,

I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to inquire about the status of the firewall rule updates for the Vlink servers. Peter Eilenberg mentioned that there was a weekly cadence with you regarding these updates, but I understand that it might have been some time since the last discussion.

We're keen on understanding if there's an expected timeline for when these updates might occur, especially since we're coordinating our internal processes around these changes. Additionally, we're updating our records to ensure the correct tags and ownership are reflected for these assets, as there have been previous misalignments.

Your insights would be incredibly helpful. Please let me know if there's any information or assistance you might need from our side. Also, if there are any relevant discussions or meetings we should join moving forward, I'd appreciate the inclusion.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Hi Dominic and Kevin,

We've noticed a laptop that is showing as externally exposed within CrowdStrike (B5B2QL3) due to ports 80, 81, and 443 being open. We're currently working on chasing down the user and appropriate desktop team to determine root cause and get those ports closed, but also wanted to check in with you in case the cyber capabilities team should look into this further for any suspicious activity. In particular, we noticed this asset had over 35k failed login attempts. Please let us know on the above and whether this should be routed over to a more appropriate group.

Hi Dominic and Kevin,

I wanted to bring something to your attention about a laptop we're seeing as externally exposed in CrowdStrike (B5B2QL3). It's showing open ports 80, 81, and 443, and we're working on figuring out who the user is and looping in the right desktop team to close those ports. With this, we also thought it might be a good idea to see if your team should take a closer look.

What's concerning is that this asset has logged over 35,000 failed login attempts. Let me know if you think this is something the Cyber Capabilities Team should dig into, or if it should be routed to someone else.

Subject: Investigation Request: High Failed Login Attempts on Device B5B2QL3

Hi SOC Team,

I hope this message finds you well. Following a discussion with Dominic and Kevin, I am reaching out to bring an urgent issue to your attention regarding a potential security concern.

We've identified an end-user device (B5B2QL3) flagged by CrowdStrike as externally exposed due to open ports 80, 81, and 443. While we are currently working with the appropriate desktop team to identify the root cause and close these ports, what stands out is the unusually high number of failed login attempts—over 35,000—recorded on this asset.

Given the volume of failed logins and Dominic and Kevin's recommendation, we believe this situation warrants further investigation by the SOC team to rule out any potential security threats.

Could you please advise on the next steps, or let us know if additional information is needed from our side?

We checked with Jonny Hjorter (Desktop Stockholm team member) and Sofia.Frode@paramount.com (the end user) on this and confirmed the following 'there should be no new reason the user knows of that the ports are open, she has not installed anything new or done anything else.'.

5. **Politeness and Professional Tone**: The tone remains professional and polite, using phrases like "thank you" to express appreciation for the recipient's assistance.

### How to Relay This Style Request in the Future:

- **Specify the Use of Bullet Points**: Indicate that information should be summarized in bullet points for clarity.

- **Emphasize Conciseness**: Request that the language be direct and succinct, avoiding overly detailed explanations unless necessary.

- **Highlight Evidence or References**: State when specific evidence, data, or named sources should be clearly mentioned to support the points being made.

- **Maintain Professional Tone**: Ask for a polite and professional tone that includes expressions of thanks or requests for assistance.

- **Use Clear Request and Action Language**: Indicate that the closing should contain a clear request for action or next steps.

Let me know if you have any additional preferences, and I can incorporate them into future messages!

Subject: Follow-Up on Vlink Server Firewall Rule Updates

Hi Ted,

I hope you're well. I'm reaching out to discuss the firewall rule updates for the Vlink servers, specifically VLINK-20091601 (IP: 192.238.76.188) and VLINK-20042801 (IP: 192.238.76.138).

In a recent conversation with Peter Eilenberg, we confirmed that VLINK-20091601 is the COE Vlink server, while VLINK-20042801 is the CND Vlink server. Both are showing open ports 80, 81, 443, and 444, which are expected, but there is an ongoing push to close ports 80 and 81.

Peter mentioned that there was previously a regular cadence with you regarding these updates, but it seems things have paused while waiting for CBS Sports to update their servers. Given this, we would appreciate any insights you might have on the timeline or the next steps, particularly if there's any action required from our side.

Additionally, our team is updating server ownership records to ensure accuracy. If there's other relevant information or another contact we should be looping in, please let me know.

In a recent conversation with Peter Eilenberg, we confirmed that VLINK-20091601 is the COE vlink server, while VLINK-20042801 is the CND vlink server. Peter mentioned that there was previously a regular cadence with you regarding these updates, alongside a push to close out ports 80 and 81, but things have paused due to delays in CBS Sports updating some of their servers.

Subject: Status Update Request: Vlink Server Firewall Rules for VLINK-20091601 and VLINK-20042801

Hi Ted,

I'm reaching out about two Vlink servers, VLINK-20091601 (IP: 192.238.76.188) and VLINK-20042801 (IP: 192.238.76.138). Both have been flagged by CrowdStrike for external exposure with open ports 80, 81, 443, and 444. Maria and I are working on identifying the asset owners and determining if these ports need to remain open.

In our conversation with Peter Eilenberg, we learned that VLINK-20091601 is the COE Vlink server and VLINK-20042801 is the CND Vlink server. Peter mentioned there was once a regular cadence with you about updating these firewall rules and a push to close ports 80 and 81. However, progress seems stalled due to delays in CBS Sports' server updates.

Could you please provide an update on the status of discussions about closing ports 80 and 81? Is there a timeline for resuming these talks, and is there anything further we can do to facilitate this process?

Thank you!
